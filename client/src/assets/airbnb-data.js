By bike or public transport you are in 10 minutes in the red light district or the Jordaan. The ferry to get to the center goes on a regular schedule and sail at night. In other words; the best of both worlds! Near Center for the real Amsterdam experience, but great to come home in the quiet and fashionable north between locals!",

Om die reden biedt ik graag mijn huis aan zodat Amsterdam beleefd kan worden zoals ik het beleef, als een zeer relaxte en vriendelijke wereldstad waar ruimte is voor iedereen!\r\nZelf ben ik heel sociaal en hou van gezelligheid. Ik ben dan ook goed in staat om leuke tips te geven zodat de ervaring in Amsterdam nog leuker wordt!",

In my younger days I worked as a hairdresser-makeupartist-and in the fashion industry. In my early working days I owned a recordstore - thats why my interest in music which varies  from popular-dance-showtunes-divas-classical -world- and much more exotica and eclectic sounds.  I also am  a big movie fan, from the early 30`s and 40`s  movies up the  the big 3 D spectacles from nowadays.  My oldtime favorite movie star is Marlene Dietrich- and the divas from the white screen during the early  years up to the present times. I have been working as international host  in many countries for special events- private parties and big gatherings- fashionweek shows and more. I have traveled the world and my favorite country is Australia with of course Melbourne as my beloved city. According eating out- I do like exotic food -clean food- vega food. Alcohol-drugs are not in my book and working out at my local gym 4 times a week is a pleasure. Of  course books are very important to broaden my vieuw on and in the world, so my reading taste is very eclectic. I speak 4 languages like: Dutch- German- French and English. My life motto is: \"Live now- don `t look back - and embrace the future with freedom of spirit and mind !!\" At this moment-I have  a quiet and relaxet lifestyle and try to make  the best of my charming boutique bnb studio, called Mark Westerpark Amsterdam, and  like to be the best host possible -giving my guests the ultimate home feeling away from their homes. I am looking forward to welcoming you, to offer you  a relaxt chill stay in my apartment in one of the most trendy areas of Amsterdam nowadays-  centre oldwest.

        "neighborhood_overview": "The Jordaan District & Nine streets. Amsterdam's Jordaan is probably the most famous neighbourhood in the Netherlands. The Jordaan is nothing but highlights. Maze-like streets offer hidden courtyards, caf\u00e9s (both traditional and trendy), art galleries and pleasantly nosy neighbours. One also has access to some of the more scenic outdoor markets in the country. In particular, Noordermarkt has a flea market on Monday mornings and an organic farmers' market on Saturdays. The quaint and quirky streets that straddle Amsterdam\u2019s grandest canals form the city\u2019s most photogenic micro-neighbourhood. Known to locals as De Negen Straatjes or \u2018The Nine Streets\u2019, this special neighbourhood is full to bursting with vintage and designer shopping, speciality stores and cosy caf\u00e9s.",
